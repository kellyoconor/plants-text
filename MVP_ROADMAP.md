# PlantTexts MVP Roadmap ðŸŒ±

## Current Status: 70-80% Complete
We have a beautiful, functional frontend with complete onboarding, plant catalog, dashboard, and chat interface. The backend has user management, plant database, and basic SMS integration. **What's missing is the intelligent plant care automation that makes the app valuable.**

- **Files**: `backend/app/services/message_generator.py`
- **Estimate**: 2 days

### 2.3 Two-Way SMS Conversation
- **Task**: Handle incoming SMS responses from users

  - Parse user responses ("watered", "done", "remind me later")
  - Update plant care records based on user actions
  - Send acknowledgment messages
  - Handle "help" and other commands
- **Files**: `backend/app/api/sms_webhook.py`
- **Estimate**: 2-3 days

---

## Phase 3: Intelligence & Personalization (Week 2-3)

### 3.1 Care History Tracking
- **Task**: Build system to learn from user behavior
- **Details**:
  - Track when users actually water vs when reminded
  - Adjust reminder frequency based on user patterns
  - Note which plants get neglected vs well-cared for
  - Store care events with timestamps
- **Files**: `backend/app/models/care_events.py`, `backend/app/services/care_tracker.py`
- **Estimate**: 2 days

### 3.2 Adaptive Scheduling
- **Task**: Make reminders smarter based on user behavior
- **Details**:
  - If user always waters 2 days late, adjust schedule
  - Increase reminder frequency for neglected plants
  - Seasonal adjustments (less water in winter)
  - "Vacation mode" for extended absences
- **Files**: `backend/app/services/adaptive_scheduler.py`
- **Estimate**: 2-3 days

### 3.3 Plant Health Insights
- **Task**: Generate health reports and suggestions
- **Details**:
  - Weekly plant health summaries via SMS
  - Identify patterns ("Your Monstera loves Tuesdays!")
  - Suggest care improvements
  - Celebrate milestones ("Sunny has been happy for 30 days!")
- **Files**: `backend/app/services/health_insights.py`
- **Estimate**: 2 days

## Phase 4: MVP Polish & Testing (Week 3-4)

### 4.1 Error Handling & Edge Cases
- **Task**: Make the system robust for real users
- **Details**:
  - Handle SMS delivery failures gracefully
  - Deal with invalid phone numbers
  - Manage plants that die or get removed
  - Rate limiting and spam protection
- **Estimate**: 2 days

### 4.2 User Onboarding Improvements
- **Task**: Ensure smooth first-time experience
- **Details**:
  - Send welcome SMS after onboarding
  - Explain how the system works
  - Set expectations for message frequency
  - Provide easy opt-out instructions
- **Files**: `backend/app/services/onboarding_flow.py`
- **Estimate**: 1 day

### 4.3 Admin Dashboard & Monitoring
- **Task**: Build tools to monitor system health
- **Details**:
  - Track SMS delivery rates
  - Monitor user engagement
  - View system errors and failed jobs
  - Basic analytics on plant care success
- **Files**: `backend/app/admin/dashboard.py`
- **Estimate**: 2-3 days

### 4.4 Testing & Bug Fixes
- **Task**: End-to-end testing with real SMS
- **Details**:
  - Test full user journey from onboarding to care reminders
  - Verify SMS delivery and responses work
