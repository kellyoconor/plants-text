# 🌱 Plant Texts — Investor Brief

**Turning plant care into delightful daily relationships through AI-powered SMS personalities**

---

## 🎯 The Opportunity

**76% of houseplants die within their first year** — not from lack of knowledge, but from lack of engagement. The $2.7B US houseplant market is growing 65% YoY, driven by Millennials and Gen Z who want to care for plants but struggle with the follow-through.

**Plant Texts solves this by making each plant a character in your phone** — they text you care reminders in their own personality, turning forgotten chores into delightful relationships.

## 💡 Product

### What It Is
Your Snake Plant becomes "Sassy" in your contacts. She texts you: *"oh look who remembered I exist 🙄"* when she needs water. You reply. She responds with attitude. You actually remember to care for your plants because it's fun.

### The Magic
- **7 AI Personalities**: Sarcastic Survivor, Dramatic Diva, Chill Friend, etc.
- **SMS-First**: Messages arrive where people already look (not another app)
- **Two-Way Chat**: Natural conversations powered by OpenAI
- **Zero Friction**: No app to download, no hardware, just texts

### Why It Works
- **Emotional Investment**: You care because they're characters you love
- **Habit Formation**: Daily texts = daily engagement = healthy plants
- **Shareability**: "My plant just roasted me" → viral content
