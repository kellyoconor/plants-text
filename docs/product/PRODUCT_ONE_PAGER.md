# 🌱 Plant Texts — Product One-Pager

**Your plants become your best friends... via text message.**

---

## 📱 The Product in One Sentence

Plant Texts gives your houseplants unique AI-powered personalities and lets them text you directly with care reminders, turning plant care from a forgotten chore into a delightful daily relationship.

---

## 😩 The Problem

**76% of houseplants die within their first year** — not from lack of information, but from lack of engagement.

### Why Traditional Solutions Fail:
- **Plant care apps get buried** in app drawers and ignored
- **Calendar reminders feel sterile** and easy to dismiss  
- **Generic notifications** don't create emotional investment
- **No accountability** or relationship with the plant
- **Plant parents forget** which plants need what care when

**The core insight:** People don't fail at plant care because they don't know how — they fail because they don't remember, don't feel connected, and don't have fun doing it.

---

## ✨ The Solution

**What if your Snake Plant was a contact in your phone?**

Plant Texts makes each of your plants into a unique character with their own personality, voice, and texting style. Instead of opening an app, you get SMS messages like:

> *"oh look who finally remembered I exist 🙄 been here 8 days without water but sure, take your time"*  
> — **Sassy (Snake Plant)**

> *"DARLING! I look absolutely STUNNING today after that water! The lighting is simply DIVINE! ✨"*  
> — **Princess (Bromeliad)**

> *"yo what's good? 😎 could use some water when you get a chance, no rush tho"*  
> — **Brad (Pothos)**

### The Magic:
- **SMS delivery** = messages arrive where people already look
- **AI personalities** = every plant feels like a unique friend
- **Two-way chat** = respond, ask questions, build relationships
- **Emotional investment** = you care because they're characters you love
- **Zero friction** = no app to open, no complex interfaces

---

## 🎯 How It Works
