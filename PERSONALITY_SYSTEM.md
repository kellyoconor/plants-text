  "conversation_history": []
}

# Get care reminder message
POST /api/v1/plants/{plant_id}/remind/{task_type}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Personality Assignment Logic

1. **Plant Catalog Lookup**: Get plant name from database
2. **Care Info Retrieval**: Query care scheduler for plant details
3. **Category Mapping**: Map plant category to personality type
4. **Fallback Handling**: Default to "chill_friend" if no mapping found

### Category ‚Üí Personality Mapping

```python
{
    "cactus and succulent": "sarcastic_survivor",
    "fern": "dramatic_communicator", 
    "bromeliad": "dramatic_diva",
    "orchid": "high_maintenance_diva",
    "foliage plant": "chill_friend",
    "dracaena": "steady_reliable",
    "palm": "steady_reliable",
    "air plant": "independent_survivor"
}
```

### Response Generation Flow

1. **Context Building**: Gather plant data, care history, personality info
2. **Prompt Construction**: Build personality-specific system prompt
3. **OpenAI Request**: Send context + user message to GPT
4. **Response Processing**: Return formatted chat response
5. **Fallback**: Use template responses if OpenAI fails

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### Performance
- **Caching**: Plant context cached per request
- **Fallbacks**: Mock responses for OpenAI downtime
- **Rate Limiting**: Built into OpenAI client

### Monitoring
- **Response Quality**: Track generic vs personality-driven responses

- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation to templates

### Scalability
- **Stateless Design**: No conversation state stored (for now)
