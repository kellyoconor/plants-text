### **The Problem**
Millions of plant parents struggle with care routines - they forget to water, over-water, or don't know what their plants need. Traditional plant care apps get buried in phones and ignored. **76% of houseplants die within the first year** due to neglect or incorrect care.

### **The Solution**
A delightful SMS service where plants text their owners directly with unique personalities, turning boring care reminders into engaging conversations.

**"Hey! Brad the Snake Plant here. Feeling pretty thirsty today, and that sunny spot you moved me to yesterday? *Chef's kiss* ðŸŒ±"**

### **How It Works**

1. **Scan & Setup** - Users scan a QR code sticker, name their plant, and choose a personality type through our simple mobile app
2. **Smart Scheduling** - Our system creates personalized care schedules based on plant type, season, and local conditions  
3. **Personality Texts** - Plants send SMS messages with care reminders, mood updates, and little stories that make users smile
4. **Interactive Care** - Users can respond to confirm care tasks or ask for help
